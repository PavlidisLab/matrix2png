	* colorscalebar.c: Many improvements - scale bars work much better
	now, including discrete values.

	* colors.c (allocateColors): works better with small numbers of
	colors. Added darkblue preset color. Color error messages are more
	informative (but now the colorerror thing seems silly).

	* colormap.c: Added numerous new maps. Maps work better with low
	color numbers selected.

	* colordiscrete.c: Discrete mappings can be used. Default map uses
	all the preset colors except for grey.

	* cmdline.h: CFLAG_OPTN shows a description in the usage line.

	* array.c: Functions handle missing values.

	* rdb-matrix.c (read_rdb_matrix_wmissing): Missing values at the
	ends of lines are now detected more robustly.

	* matrix2png.c: -numcols is now -numcolors.

	* normalize: added command line option -n to normalize the rows i.e.,
	N(0,1) of the matrix. Currently this is done before taking numr
	and numc into account.

	* matrix2png.c range determination is skipped if 0 rows are
	selected. This now cleans up response of the program when zero
	rows are selected, which lets us make headers only.

	* Fixed bug where when not using all rows or columns got too many
	row labels; now also works correctly with single columns files.

	* text2png.h: calcTextDimensions and stringlist2image accept
	numtodo argument so not all strings are necessarily used.

	* verbosity is now a command line option; set to 3 or more to get
	more output to stderr. This affects range output when not using
	range, or using outlier trimming.
 
	* input accepted on stdin using "-" instead of a data file name

	* numtodo is deprecated; replaced with numr (number of rows) and
	numc (number of columns).
