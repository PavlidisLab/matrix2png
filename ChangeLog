	* normalize: added command line option -n to normalize the rows i.e.,
	N(0,1) of the matrix. Currently this is done before taking numr
	and numc into account.

	* matrix2png.c range determination is skipped if 0 rows are
	selected. This now cleans up response of the program when zero
	rows are selected, which lets us make headers only.

	* Fixed bug where when not using all rows or columns got too many
	row labels; now also works correctly with single columns files.

	* text2png.h: calcTextDimensions and stringlist2image accept
	numtodo argument so not all strings are necessarily used.

	* verbosity is now a command line option; set to 3 or more to get
	more output to stderr. This affects range output when not using
	range, or using outlier trimming.
 
	* input accepted on stdin using "-" instead of a data file name

	* numtodo is deprecated; replaced with numr (number of rows) and
	numc (number of columns).
